# Web-Search-Engine
This project was done as the course project for CS582: Information Retrieval course at the University of Illinois at Chicago during the Spring 2021 term.

The goal of the project is to design and implement a web search engine for the UIC domain. The search engine includes a web crawler, preprocessing and indexing of web pages, and an IR system implementing a vector-space model to retrieve webpages relevant to an input user query.
